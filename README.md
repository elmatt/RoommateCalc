RoommateCalc
============

I wanted to save 5 minutes every month so I decided to create a pretty customized version of our rent. We owe $999 total for the house
that we are renting. Our landlord wants the rent due in 3 checks. To save the convience of having to swap cash with the roommates, we
have decided to deduct and add rent to each roommates's total to make up for them paying the utilties, cable, et cetera. I wanted it to 
also text the roommate the total amount they owe to save more time.
