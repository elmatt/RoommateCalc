RoommateCalc
============

I wanted to save 5 minutes every month so I decided to create a pretty customized version of our rent. We owe $999 total for the house
that we are renting. Our landlord wants the rent due in 3 checks. To save the convience of having to swap cash with each other, we
have decided to deduct/add rent to each tenant's total to make up for them paying the utilties, cable, et cetera. I wanted it to 
also text the roommate their total to save more time.
