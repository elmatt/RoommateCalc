RoommateCalc
============

I wanted to save some time every month, so I decided to create a pretty customized version of our rent. We owe $999 total for the house
that we are renting. For the 3 total tenants in our house, we each owe $333. Our landlord wants the rent due in 3 checks. To save the convience of having to swap cash with the roommates, we
have decided to deduct and add rent to each roommates's total to make up for them paying the utilties, cable, et cetera. I also added the feature of texting the roommate the total amount they owe.
